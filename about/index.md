Hello. My name is Alvin Ghouas.

Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” *Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice* (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s *Visual Explanations*.'  %}

I am senior at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science with an interest in data visualization and education technology. 

In my spare time I enjoy running, climbing and tinkering with software projects.
